What is inside?
This Folder contains three different c files, a solutions text file, and this
readme.

How do I run this?
run part B  using:
gcc partb.c -o partb

run part C using:
gcc partc.c -o partc => then run partc with either -s or -l


finall run part D using:
,
gcc partd.c -o partd => we can do the same as partc except we can now ad
numerical values to initialze our counter for the load averages.
